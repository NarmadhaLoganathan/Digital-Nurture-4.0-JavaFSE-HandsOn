# ðŸš€ Microservices Load Balancing - Exercise 2

This project demonstrates how to implement **load balancing** using **Spring Cloud Gateway** in a microservices architecture. Two identical services (`example-service-1` and `example-service-2`) are registered behind a **Gateway** which routes incoming requests to either service in a load-balanced way.

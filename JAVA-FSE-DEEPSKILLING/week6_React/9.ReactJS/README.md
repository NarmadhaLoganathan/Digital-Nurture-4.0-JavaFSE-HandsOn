#  Cricket App (ReactJS)

This is a fun little React app to display cricket players using ES6 features like `map`, `arrow functions`, `destructuring`, and `spread operator`.

---

## What it does

Depending on a flag, the app shows:

### When flag = true:
-  A list of 11 players with their scores
-  A filtered list of players who scored less than 70

### When flag = false:
-  Odd and Even players from an array using destructuring
-  A merged list of T20 and Ranji Trophy players using the spread operator

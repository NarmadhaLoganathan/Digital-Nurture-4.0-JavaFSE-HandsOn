# BlogApp – React Hands-On Project

Hello! This is a simple **ReactJS project** I built as part of my **Week 6 hands-on assignment** in the Java FSE training program. The goal of this task was to understand how React works and how to create and display components.

---

##  What this project is about

In this mini project, I created a small blog-style application using React. It shows a list of blog posts with a title and description.

---



- `App.js` – This is the main component that renders the blog post list.
- `Posts.js` – This component contains all the blog posts in one place.
- `Post.js` – This is a reusable component that displays each individual blog post.

##  What I learned

- How to **create components** in React.
- How to **pass props** between components.
- How to display **reusable UI blocks**.
- How to organize files in a clean folder structure.

##  Sample Output

Here’s how the final output looks in the browser:

- Page Title: **Blog Posts**
- Each blog post is displayed in a card-style box.
- Titles are bold and highlighted.
- Content is clean and readable.

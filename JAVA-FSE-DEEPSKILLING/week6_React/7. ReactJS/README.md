#  ReactJS - Handson 7: Online Shopping Cart

This project is part of the Week 6 ReactJS Hands-on sessions from the CTS Full Stack Engineering training. The goal is to build a simple shopping cart application using React that displays items in a neat table format.

## What is This App?

This is a basic React app that shows a list of 7 shopping items with their **name**, **brand**, and **price**, all neatly displayed in a table. It helps understand how to:

- Create React components
- Render data using JSX
- Use CSS for styling
- Show tabular data using `<table>` elements

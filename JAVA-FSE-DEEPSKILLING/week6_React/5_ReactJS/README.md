#  React Cohort Dashboard – Styling Components

Hello! This is my fifth React hands-on task for Week 6, focused on **styling React components** using CSS Modules and inline styles. In this lab, I worked on a dashboard showing cohort details with visual improvements using CSS.

---

##  Objectives

- Understand the need for styling in React components.
- Learn how to use **CSS Modules**.
- Apply styles using both `className` and inline `style` properties.

---

## What I Did

- Created a new file: `CohortDetails.module.css` to define custom styles.
- Added a `box` class for styling the component container (width, padding, margin, border).
- Styled the `<dt>` tag to make its font semi-bold.
- Used conditional inline styling in the React component to:
  - Show cohort status in **green** if it’s "ongoing".
  - Show **blue** color for all other statuses.





---

##  Key Learnings

- CSS Modules help to **avoid style conflicts** and **scope styles locally**.
- You can use **JavaScript logic inside React** to style elements dynamically.
- Proper styling improves the look and feel of a web application significantly.

##  How to Run

1. Open terminal in your project folder.
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Start app: `npm start`
4. Visit: (http://localhost:3000)

---

##  Final Output

- Each cohort appears inside a styled box.
- The `<dt>` tag looks cleaner with bold text.
- "Ongoing" status shows in **green**, others in **blue**.

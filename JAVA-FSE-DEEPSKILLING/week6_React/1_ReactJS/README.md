# Week 6 – React Hands-on Lab

 Task Given:

We were asked to create a new React application with the name **"myfirstreact"**.  
The main goal was to display the text:

> **"Welcome to the first session of React"**

as a heading on the home page of the app.


## What I Did:

- I already had Node.js, npm, and Visual Studio Code installed because of previous projects.
- I created a new folder for this week’s React hands-on inside my project directory.
- Then, I set up a new React project named `myfirstreact` using the React setup tool.
- I opened the project in Visual Studio Code and edited the main file to show the required message.
- Finally, I ran the app and opened it in the browser to check the output.

---

## What I Learned:

- I understood what a **Single Page Application (SPA)** is and how React helps create it.
- I learned how to create a simple React app and how the file structure is organized.
- I now understand how to edit the main component (`App.js`) in React to display content.
- I got a clear idea of how React apps are run in the browser during development.

##  Tools Used:

- **React** – JavaScript library used to build the app
- **Node.js & npm** – To set up and manage the React project
- **Visual Studio Code** – To edit the project files
- **Web Browser** – To view the output of the React app

---

##  Output:

The browser successfully displayed the heading as required:

> **Welcome to the first session of React**
